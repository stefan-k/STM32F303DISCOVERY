# Gravity is up?

What's the first thing we'll do?

Perform a sanity check!

The starter code prints the X, Y and Z components of the acceleration measured
by the accelerometer. The values have already been "scaled" and have units of
`g`s. Where `1 g` is equal to the acceleration of the gravity, about `9.8`
meters per second squared.

``` rust
#![deny(unsafe_code)]
#![no_main]
#![no_std]

#[macro_use]
extern crate pg;

use pg::I16x3;
use pg::{delay, lsm303dlhc};

#[inline(never)]
#[no_mangle]
pub fn main() -> ! {
    loop {
        const SENSITIVITY: f32 = 8. / ((1 << 15) as f32); // mg / LSB

        let I16x3 { x, y, z } = lsm303dlhc::acceleration();

        let x = f32::from(x) * SENSITIVITY;
        let y = f32::from(y) * SENSITIVITY;
        let z = f32::from(z) * SENSITIVITY;

        iprintln!("{:?}", (x, y, z));

        delay::ms(1_000);
    }
}
```

The output of this program with the board sitting still is:

```
# itmdump's console
(0, 0, 1.03125)
(0, 0, 1.015625)
(0, 0, 1.03125)
```

Which is weird because the board is not moving yet its acceleration is non-zero.
What's going on? This must be related to the gravity, right? Because the
acceleration of gravity is `1 g`. But the gravity pulls objects downwards so the
acceleration along the Z axis should be negative not positive ...

Did the program get the Z axis backwards? Nope, you can test rotating the board
to align the gravity to the X or Y axis but the acceleration measured by the
accelerometer is always pointing up.

What happens here is that the accelerometer is measuring the "proper"
acceleration of the board not the acceleration *you* are observing. This proper
acceleration is the acceleration of the board as seen from a observer that's in
free fall. An observer that's in free fall is moving toward the center of the
the Earth with an acceleration of `1 g` but from its point of view the board is
actually moving upwards (away from the center of the Earth) with an acceleration
of `1 g`. And that's why the proper acceleration is pointing up. This also means
that if the board was in free fall, the accelerometer would report a "proper"
acceleration of zero. Please, don't try that at home.

Yes, physics is hard. Let's move on.
